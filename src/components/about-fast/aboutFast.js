        <p>
          <span>Fast Credit Limited (FCL)</span> was incorporated in 2014 as a
          Central bank of Nigeria licensed non-bank financial institution to
          provide various financial services to individuals, consumers, SMEs and
          corporates, across the country. The company is a leader in the
          provision of microcredit to salary-based employees in both the public
          and private sector using digital technology through payroll lending
          services in a fast and convenient manner while impacting their lives
          and improving the standard of living nationwide given the huge gap in
          credit accessibility for the general populace. The company whose
          Headquarter is in Lagos with locations across the country, also
          provides investment services via its various innovative products that
          yield higher returns above the traditional financial institutions'
          rate. Fast Credit also leverages modern technology and partnerships to
          provide clients with payment solutions that are fast and efficient and
          cater for the daily needs of individuals through their smartphones and
          other devices. The company is committed to responsible lending, the
          highest service standard in delighting customers in the provision of
          unsecured loans to millions of Nigerians and thus promoting financial
          inclusion.
